        <h2>Introduction & Project Goals</h2>
        <p>
          As one of the few kosher restaurants in my hometown of Riverdale, New
          York, Kai Fan has long been a go-to option for delivery. I chose to
          redesign Kai Fan’s website to address its outdated design, confusing
          navigation, and poor visual hierarchy, all of which created
          significant barriers to an enjoyable user experience
        </p>
        <p>
          My overarching goal was to build a modern, responsive, and visually
          appealing interface that prioritizes user needs. By streamlining
          navigation and ensuring clarity in design, I aimed to help customers
          seamlessly find essential info—like hours, location, and menu
          options—while reflecting Kai Fan’s brand identity.

        <h2>Usability Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Using five core criteria—Efficiency, Memorability, Learnability,
          Conceptual Model, and Accessibility—I analyzed how the original Kai
          Fan website impacts user interactions and where it falls short. Expand
          each section below to see the specific issues discovered.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The “A Destination” section tons of space with only two lines
                  of text, wasting valuable screen real estate while also
                  looking visually unnapealing
                </li>
                <li>
                  Multiple "Order Online" buttons create confusion about which
                  one to use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The site lacks a built-in menu page—users must click “Order
                  Online,” leading to an external site and adding friction for
                  simple menu browsing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Key info like business hours and location is buried at the
                  bottom, forcing users to scroll and search for basic details.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On mobile, unoptimized images slow loading times, further
                  reducing efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Repetitive promotional text (“All you can eat sushi is back…”)
                  clutters the homepage, making it harder to find important
                  information.
                </li>
              </ul>

                  Text-heavy promotions precede essential details (like hours,
                  location, and food options), making users repeatedly hunt for
                  key info.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Large image captions (“FRESH INGREDIENTS,” “MASTER CHEF”)
                  appear interactive but aren't clickable, creating confusion on
                  subsequent visits. They don't add anything important, yet make
                  the site confusing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A lack of a distinctive color scheme or typography makes it
                  difficult for returning users to recognize Kai Fan’s site from
                  others.

                  The “Order Online” button is not very noticeable, it blends
                  into the background due to a thin white outline that contrasts
                  poorly. Users may not recognize it as a call to action button.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No hover effects or animations guide a first-time user’s
                  attention, missing a key opportunity for to aid site learning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The prominent “All you can eat sushi” banner competes visually
                  with key navigation elements but doesn’t clarify how to take
                  advantage of the deal in-person or online.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Outdated visual hierarchy leads to multiple large text
                  elements vying for attention, leaving newcomers unsure where
                  to look first.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Users expecting a "Menu" page may not realize that the "Order
                  Now" button is where the menu is found. This slows down a
                  newcomer looking to learn the site structure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No clear color-coding or guidance leaves new users to figure
                  out the site on their own.

                  The site funnels menu browsing into an external ordering
                  system, breaking users’ expectations of viewing a menu
                  in-page. Menu and ordering should be front and center.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Large promotions precede basic context, forcing users to

                <li>
                  The hidden main menu deviates from standard restaurant sites,
                  potentially causing users to miss or misunderstand the
                  available pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Irrelevant paragraphs and unappetizing pictures further

        <h2>Visual Redesign Process</h2>
        <p>
          I structured my redesign around four key stages: establishing a style
          guide, creating detailed mockups for multiple breakpoints, coding the
          layout, and testing for usability and accessibility.

        <p>
          This iterative approach helped ensure that each design decision was
          validated through user feedback and testing. By the end, I had a
          cohesive redesign that addressed the major pain points identified
          during the initial analysis.

          The redesign relies on a color palette, pairing teal with dark grey
          and white. Roboto, Open Sans and Raleway were primarily used for
          texts. Buttons, links, and hover states follow consistent design
          rules, making interactions predictable and coherent.

          I produced high-fidelity mockups for mobile, tablet, and desktop. Each

          color scheme—but reflows them to fit the available screen space.

          The mockup featured intuitive, responsive layouts with reusable

          I implemented improvements to address the key issues identified in our
          analysis:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Efficiency:</strong>
            <span
              >Redundant elements were eliminated and the navigation streamlined
              so that essential details like operating hours and location are
              immediately visible. Unnecessary content was removed to reduce
              friction.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Learnability:</strong>
            <span
              >Micro-interactions, hover effects, and clear visual cues were
              introduced. Updated labels and guidance help new users quickly
              understand how to interact with the site.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Memorability:</strong>
            <span
              >A distinctive color palette and updated typography were adopted.
              A persistent, intuitive navigation bar ensures returning visitors
              can easily recognize and recall the brand.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Conceptual Model:</strong>
            <span
              >Content was reorganized to match user expectations. Misleading or
              static elements were removed to create a logical, intuitive flow
              throughout the site.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessibility:</strong>
            <span
              >Color contrast was improved, descriptive alt text was added, and
              interactive elements were optimized to meet WCAG guidelines,
              making the site more inclusive for users with disabilities.</span
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These enhancements transformed the site into a user-friendly and
          effective digital experience.

          This project was a fun excersize that taught me several critical
          lessons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Attention to Detail:</strong>
            <span
              >Subtle choices like precise color contrasts and
              micro-interactions can make a huge difference.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User Focused Design:</strong>
            <span
              >Aligning design decisions with real user needs and mental models
              is very important.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Balance of Aesthetics and Functionality:</strong>
            <span
              >The project highlighted the necessity of creating a visually
              appealing interface without sacrificing usability or
              accessibility.</span

          This was my first site redesign and I enjoyed looking at a site,
          assessing its strengths and weaknesses, and then fixing it myself!
